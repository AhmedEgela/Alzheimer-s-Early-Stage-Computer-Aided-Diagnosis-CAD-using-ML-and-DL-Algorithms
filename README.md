# Alzheimer-s-Early-Stage-Computer-Aided-Diagnosis-CAD-using-ML-and-DL-Algorithms
## Project Overview
This work explores the beyonds of early-stage computer-aid diagnosis for Alzheimerâ€™s disease using ML and DL algorithms. Alzheimer's disease is considered as the common nature of dementia. Unfortunately, this disease is diagnosed after a massive neural damage in the brain. So, this work aims to improve the early diagnosis using noninvasive MRI data. Three pipelines were used: ML, DL, and hybrid pipelines to reach this aim.
